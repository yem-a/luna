1. Overview

Product Name: Task Planning & Update Agent

This PoC demonstrates an AI agent's capability to generate, maintain, and dynamically update project tasks, dependencies, and resource estimates from an existing PRD as the project evolves.

2. Objectives
	1.	Task Generation & Planning
	•	Automatically generate structured tasks and dependencies from an existing PRD
	•	Produce a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) or simplified Gantt chart
	2.	Adaptive Planning
	•	Support iterative updates to tasks and recalculate impact on dependencies and man-hour estimates
	•	Provide impact analysis for changes
	3.	User-Friendly Interaction
	•	Provide a minimal UI or command-line interface for task-related discussions
	•	Reflect changes in real time

3. In-Scope Features
	1.	AI-Powered Task Generation
	•	Parse existing PRD to extract actionable tasks
	•	Generate logical task dependencies and relationships
	2.	Task & Dependency Mapping
	•	Convert requirements into tasks with logical dependencies
	•	Represent dependencies as a DAG or a basic Gantt chart
	•	Support task prioritization (Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have)
	•	Include risk assessment for each major task/dependency
	3.	Man-Hours Estimation
	•	Each task has an estimated number of hours or story points
	•	Changes to tasks automatically trigger recalculation of total man-hours
	•	Include confidence levels for estimates (High/Medium/Low)
	4.	Real-Time Updates
	•	After discussion with the AI, the system updates:
		-	The task list, dependencies, and man-hour totals
		-	Impact analysis on project timeline and resources
		-	Notification of critical path changes

4. Out-of-Scope for PoC
	•	PRD Generation/Refinement (handled by separate agent)
	•	Full UI/UX Implementation
	•	Integration with Existing Tools
	•	Multi-Team Collaboration
	•	Track estimation accuracy over time
	•	Versioning & Audit (Minimal)
	•	Track incremental changes to tasks

5. High-Level Architecture
	1.	Frontend/Interface (Lightweight)
	•	Simple web interface or command-line tool for task-related interactions
	•	Displays tasks, dependencies, and man-hour counts
	2.	AI Layer
	•	LLM (e.g., GPT or similar model) handles:
		-	Task list generation from PRD
		-	Task updates and refinements
		-	Estimation updates based on user feedback
	•	May include a prompt engineering approach for consistent task generation
	3.	Data & Logic Layer
	•	Data Store: Simple JSON files in local repository storing:
		-	Task list
		-	Dependencies
		-	Time estimates
	•	Dependency/Graph Manager: Constructs and updates the DAG/Gantt chart data structure
	•	Estimation Engine: Simple rules-based or heuristic formula to recalculate man-hours upon changes

6. Implementation Plan
	1.	LLM Integration
	•	Use an existing LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) to:
		-	Parse PRD and generate initial task list
		-	Generate task dependencies and initial time estimates
	2.	Data Model & Storage
	•	Define schemas for:
		-	Tasks: ID, title, description, dependencies, estimated hours
	•	Store data in a simple database (or even in-memory for a quick PoC)
	3.	Dependency & Gantt Module
	•	Based on tasks' dependencies, construct a DAG
	•	Generate a simplified Gantt chart representation for visual output
	4.	Update Mechanism
	•	When user discusses changes, the LLM updates tasks and dependencies
	•	A small rules-based system re-checks dependencies and recalculates man-hours
	5.	Minimal User Interface
	•	Web-based or CLI with these capabilities:
		-	View Tasks: "Show me the tasks and man-hour estimates"
		-	Update Tasks: "This task is bigger than we thought"
		-	Generate Visuals: Display updated DAG/Gantt
	6.	Testing
	•	User Flow Tests: Validate task updates and visualization
	•	LLM Accuracy Tests: Check if task generation is logical and consistent
	•	Dependency/Man-Hours Update Tests: Confirm changes cascade correctly

7. Timeline (Example)
	•	Day 1:
		-	Finalize task data schemas
		-	Basic LLM prompt engineering for task generation
	•	Day 2:
		-	Implement task generation from PRD
	•	Day 3:
		-	Add dependency/graph management logic
		-	Build man-hour estimation logic
	•	Day 4:
		-	Create basic UI/CLI
		-	Test task updates
		-	Demo internal testing

8. Success Criteria
	1.	Usability: A user can easily view and update tasks
	2.	Adaptiveness: Task changes are reflected in real-time with updated dependencies and man-hours
	3.	Accuracy: 
		-	Estimation confidence levels should match actual outcomes 70% of the time
		-	Critical path calculations should be 90% accurate
		-	Dependency identification should have less than 10% false positives
	4.	Performance:
		-	System should handle projects with up to 100 tasks
	5.	Clarity: Task relationships and updates are clearly presented
	6.	Stability: Task management workflows work reliably with no crashes

Conclusion

This PRD outlines the minimal but essential components for a Proof of Concept demonstration of an LLM-based task management system. By focusing on intelligent task generation and updates, you can quickly validate the core idea and gather feedback before expanding to a full product.
